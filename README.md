## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Real-time Conway's Game of Life simulation
- **Mouse Controls**: Click and drag to create/remove cells
- **Keyboard Controls**: Space to play/pause, R to reset, Escape to quit
- **Performance Optimized**: Multi-threaded Game of Life algorithm
- **Dynamic UI**: Real-time display of iteration count, population, and iterations per second
- **Resizable Window**: Automatically adjusts grid to window size
- **Cross-platform**: Built with SDL2 for compatibility across different operating systems

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- SDL2 development libraries
- SDL2_ttf development libraries

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

#### On macOS (with Homebrew):
```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_ttf
```

#### On Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf
```

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tom-Mendy/RustOfLife.git
   cd RustOfLife
   ```

2. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

   Or use the provided script:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

## 🎮 Controls

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Left Mouse Button** | Toggle cell state (click) or paint cells (drag) |
| **Right Mouse Button** | Erase cells (drag) |
| **Space** | Play/Pause simulation |
| **R** | Reset grid (clear all cells) |
| **Escape** | Exit application |

## 🏗️ Building

### Development Build
```bash
cargo build
```

### Optimized Release Build
```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cargo test
```

Or with coverage:
```bash
./test.sh
```

## 🐳 Docker Support

Build and run using Docker:

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Run the container
docker-compose up
```

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Using Nix Flakes (Recommended)
This project includes a Nix flake for reproducible development environments:

```bash
# Enter the development shell
nix develop

# Or with direnv
echo "use flake" > .envrc
direnv allow
```

The Nix environment provides:
- Rust toolchain with rust-analyzer
- SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries
- Additional development tools (cargo-watch, cargo-edit, etc.)

## 🧬 Game of Life Rules

Conway's Game of Life follows these simple rules:

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive
2. **Survival**: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive
3. **Death**: A live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors dies

## 🔧 Configuration

The game uses a default configuration that can be modified in `src/game.rs`:

- **Grid Size**: 100x100 cells
- **Window Size**: 1000x1000 pixels
- **Max Iterations/Second**: 10 (configurable)

## 🎯 Performance

- **Multi-threaded**: Game of Life calculations use thread parallelization
- **Optimized Rendering**: Efficient SDL2 rendering with minimal allocations
- **Release Mode**: Compiled with aggressive optimizations (`opt-level = 3`, LTO)

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Game logic and rules
- SDL2 integration
- Event handling
- UI components

Run tests with:
```bash
cargo test --verbose
```
